#### Python programming concepts
- Object oriented programming in Python
    - Using and defining special python methods (dunder methods).
    - Immutable objects.
    - Making an object hashable (implementing `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods.
    - Implementing decortors in Python.
    - Class methods and static methods.
    - `__repr__()` and `__str__()` methods.

### Second part:
- Machine learning
    - Supervised learning:
        - KNN, Naive Bayes, Desision Trees, SVM, Neural Nets
    - Unsupervised learning:
        - k-Means clustering
    - Reinforcement learning
        - Q-learning

### Example problems
- Search:
    - N-Puzzle, N-Queens, TSP
- Games:
    - Pacman, Chess
- Learning:
    - Pacman, Chess, etc.

### Lesson 1: Uninformed (blind) search strategies
- Implementing data structures like stack, queue and priority queue
- Implementing N-Puzzle (8-Puzzle)
- Implementing uninformed search strategies: BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDS
- Programming assignment

### Lesson 2: Informed search strategies
- Implementing informed search strategies: Greedy, A-star
- Programming assignment

### Lesson 3: Local search
- Implementing N-Queens and TSP(a graphical implementation)
- Implementing local search strategies: hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms
- Programming assignment

### Lesson 4: Adversarial search and games
